# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this study guide as an educational, step-by-step way to be prepared for my first day of coding bootcamp at UCLA Extenstion. I was motivated by wanting to make sure that I was prepared for my first day, and I built it because I knew getting hands-on experience is the best way for me to learn. I also took 17 pages of notes on a google doc as I read and watched all of the resources included in the prework modules. It solves the problem of having baseline knowledge of the material, and not being completely lost on day one, as we have a lot to learn in these quick 6 months. I learned a lot! I had a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS from college, and JavaScript from a free course I've been doing online. But I had 0 knowledge of git, github, and VS code. Seeing all these programs linked together has been super fascinating.

Each section contains some of the notes I took on all the different lessons I did throughout the prework. If you open the console in DevTools, you can see the JavaScript added in Module 3 running. It will pick a topic at random to start with.
